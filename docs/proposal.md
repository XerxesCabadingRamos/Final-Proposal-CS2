## Project Proposal (Draft)

# Project Title:
- CoffeePH

# Problem Statement

- In many coffee businesses, owners often find it difficult to analyze customer orders, identify preferences, and track product trends efficiently. Understanding what customers buy and how they customize their drinks, such as sugar level or milk preference, can help improve product offerings and service.
This project uses a dataset of customer coffee transactions to help summarize key insights, such as the number of latte orders, sugar preferences, and average quantity purchased.

# Project Objectives

- Objective 1: To analyze customer data from the JSON dataset and extract key information.
- Objective 2: To identify order trends, such as popular drinks and customer preferences.
- Objective 3: To compute basic statistics, like the number of latte orders and the average quantity ordered.
- Objective 4: To enhance understanding of JSON data handling in Python.

# Planned Features

- Feature 1: Count how many people ordered a latte.
- Feature 2: Count how many people prefer less or no sugar.
- Feature 3: Compute the average quantity of coffee ordered.
- Feature 4: Display total sales for all completed transactions.
- Feature 5: List all customers with their order status (Completed, Pending, or Cancelled).
- Feature 6: Identify the most popular coffee type.

# Planned Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs:
User may input new transaction details (main and side info) such as:
• Item name, quantity, price, status
• Manufacturer, location, time, preferences

- Outputs:
The outputs that the will display will include:
• Total number of latte orders
• Number of customers who wanted less or no sugar
• Average coffee quantity
• Total revenue of completed orders
• List of all transactions with statuses

# Logic Plan (Pseudocode)

  Start Program
  Load or create JSON data
  Display Menu:
    1. Count latte orders
    2. Count no/less sugar preferences
    3. Compute average quantity
    4. Show total sales (Completed only)
    5. Display all customer transactions
    6. Exit
  If user chooses option 1 → Loop through dataset, count items containing “Latte”
  If user chooses option 2 → Search preferences for “no sugar” or “less sugar”
  If user chooses option 3 → Add all quantities and divide by total customers
  If user chooses option 4 → Add (quantity * price) for Completed status
  If user chooses option 5 → Print transaction details
  Repeat menu until user exits
  End Program
